### What is RTKBaseView?

RTKBaseView is a heavily modified fork of Emlid's ReachView for working with [RTKBase](https://github.com/Stefal/rtkbase).

RTKBaseView is a web-interface for RTKLIB hosted on u-blox M8T/F9P (and maybe other) receivers and non-Intel Edison SBCs.

### Running/testing/debugging instructions

At the moment RTKBaseView has been tested on an Orange Pi Zero running Armbian Buster 5.4.28. 
RTKBaseView works with Python 3

You can launch RTKBaseView by running `sudo ./server.py` from the web_app directory.
